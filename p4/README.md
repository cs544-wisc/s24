# P4 (6% of grade): HDFS Replication

## [Github Classroom Link](https://classroom.github.com/a/LeHl5F7g)
## Overview

HDFS can *partition* large files into blocks to share the storage
across many workers, and it can *replicate* those blocks so that data
is not lost even if some workers die.

In this project, you'll deploy a small HDFS cluster and upload a large
file to it, with different replication settings.  You'll write Python
code to read the file.  When data is partially lost (due to a node
failing), your code will recover as much data as possible from the
damaged file.

**Remember to switch to an e2-medium for this project:** [VM schedule](../projects.md#compute-setup). Note you can edit your existing instance to an e2-medium instead of deleting your old one and creating a new VM. This [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/changing-machine-type-of-stopped-instance) should help you switch over.

If you switched machines, remember to reinstall Docker and to also enable Docker to be run without sudo. Refer to P1 for instructions. 

Learning objectives:
* use the HDFS command line client to upload files
* use the webHDFS API (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.3.6/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/WebHDFS.html) to read files
* use PyArrow to read HDFS files
* relate replication count to space efficiency and fault tolerance

Before starting, please review the [general project directions](../projects.md).

**Before proceeding, [please make sure you created your project repository](https://classroom.github.com/a/LeHl5F7g)** 

## Corrections/Clarifications

## Step 0: GIT Preparations

While Git is very helpful for keeping track of code changes, the reality is that most directories contain files that we don't want to track (such as large csv files in the case of most 544 projects). Git allows us to intentionally ignore certain files via including a `.gitignore` file. When you include a file in the `.gitignore`, git will not track changes to it. .`gitignore` files also support a limited set of [regex](https://ubuntu.com/blog/regex-basics) characters, enabling us to disabling the tracking of entire types of files. There are plenty of language specfic `.gitignore` templates available  that you can use as a starting point (for example, here is the [Python `.gitignore`](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore) that Github provides). In our case, it is pertinent to tell git to ignore csv files. To do so, you should add the following lines to your `.gitignore` file: `*.csv`. and `*.csv.[0-9]*` 


## Part 1: Deployment and Data Upload


Before you begin, please run  the `setup.sh` file in your p4 directory. This will download needed files and save you the effort of manually copying over project files.

#### Cluster

For this project, you'll deploy a small cluster of containers, one
with Jupyter, one with an HDFS NameNode, and two with HDFS DataNodes.

We have given you `docker-compose.yml` for starting the cluster, but
you need to build some images first.  Start with the following:

```
docker build . -f hdfs.Dockerfile -t p4-hdfs
docker build . -f notebook.Dockerfile -t p4-nb
```

The second image depends on the first one (`p4-hdfs`) allowing us to avoid repeating imports --you can see
this by checking the `FROM` line in "notebook.Dockerfile".

The compose file also needs `p4-nn` (NameNode) and `p4-dn` (DataNode)
images.  Create Dockerfiles for these that can be built like this:

```
docker build . -f namenode.Dockerfile -t p4-nn
docker build . -f datanode.Dockerfile -t p4-dn
```

Requirements:
* like `p4-nb`, both these should use `p4-hdfs` as a base
* `namenode.Dockerfile` should run two commands:
 ```
 hdfs namenode -format
 ```
 ```
 hdfs namenode -D dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval=1000 -D dfs.namenode.heartbeat.recheck-interval=1000 -D dfs.heartbeat.interval=1000ms -D dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode=True -fs hdfs://boss:9000
  ```
* `datanode.Dockerfile` should run 

```
hdfs datanode -D dfs.datanode.data.dir=/var/datanode -fs hdfs://boss:9000
```

You can use `docker compose up` to start your mini cluster. Examine the messages to make sure it launched ok. In future launches, you can use `docker compose up -d`.


You can run `docker compose kill; docker compose rm -f` to stop and delete
all the containers in your cluster as needed.  For simplicity, we
recommend this rather than restarting a single container when you need
to change something as it avoids some tricky issues with HDFS.  For
example, if you just restart+reformat the container with the NameNode,
the old DataNodes will not work with the new NameNode without a more
complicated process/config.


#### Data Upload

Connect to JupyterLab running in the `p4-nb` container, and create a
notebook called `p4a.ipynb` in the "/nb" directory (we'll do some
later work in another notebook, `p4b.ipynb`). **Note that juypterlab is being
hosted on port 5000 instead of 5440**

#### Q1: how many live DataNodes are in the cluster?

Write a cell like this (and use a similar format for other questions):

```
#q1
! SHELL COMMAND TO CHECK
```

The shell command should generate a report by passing some arguments
to `hdfs dfsadmin`.  The output should contain a line like this (you
might need to wait and re-run this command a bit to give the DataNodes
time to show up):

```
...
Live datanodes (2):
...
```

Write some code (Python or shell) that downloads
https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~harter/cs544/data/hdma-wi-2021.csv if it
hasn't already been downloaded.

Next, use two `hdfs dfs -cp` commands to upload this same file to HDFS
twice, to the following locations:

* `hdfs://boss:9000/single.csv`
* `hdfs://boss:9000/double.csv`

In both cases, use a 1MB block size (`dfs.block.size`), and
replication (`dfs.replication`) of 1 and 2 for `single.csv` and
`double.csv`, respectively.

If you want to re-run your notebook from the top and have the files
re-created, consider having a cell with the following, prior to the
`cp` commands.

```
!hdfs dfs -rm -f hdfs://boss:9000/single.csv
!hdfs dfs -rm -f hdfs://boss:9000/double.csv
```

#### Q2: what are the logical and physical sizes of the CSV files?

Run a `du` command with `hdfs dfs` to see.

You should see something like this:

```
166.8 M  333.7 M  hdfs://main:9000/double.csv
166.8 M  166.8 M  hdfs://main:9000/single.csv
```

The first columns show the logical and physical sizes.  The two CSVs
contain the same data, so they have the same logical sizes.  Note the
difference in physical size due to replication, though.

## Part 2: WebHDFS

The documents here describe how we can interact with HDFS via web requests: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.3.6/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/WebHDFS.html.

Many examples show these web requests being made with the `curl` command, but you'll adapt those examples to use `requests.get` (https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/).

By default, WebHDFS runs on port 9870. **So use port 9870 instead of 9000 for this part.**

#### Q3: what is the file status for single.csv?

Use the `GETFILESTATUS` operation to find out, and answer with a
dictionary (the request returns JSON).

Note that if `r` is a response object, then `r.content` will contain
some bytes, which you could convert to a dictionary; alternatively,
`r.json()` does this for you.

The result should look something like this:

```
{'FileStatus': {...
  'blockSize': 1048576,
  ...
  'length': 174944099,
  ...
  'replication': 1,
  'storagePolicy': 0,
  'type': 'FILE'}}
```

The `blockSize` and `length` fields might be helpful for future
questions.

#### Q4: what is the location for the first block of single.csv?

Use the `OPEN` operation with `offset` 0 and `noredirect=true` - (`length` and `buffersize` are optional).
Your answer should be a string, similar to this:

```python
'http://6a2464e4ba5c:9864/webhdfs/v1/single.csv?op=OPEN&namenoderpcaddress=boss:9000&offset=0'
```

Note that `6a2464e4ba5c` was the randomly generated container ID for
the container running the DataNode, so yours will be different.

#### Q5: how are the blocks of single.csv distributed across the two DataNode containers?

This is similar to above, except you should check every block and extract the container ID from the URL.

You should produce a Python dictionary similar to below (your IDs and counts will be different, of course).

```python
{'6a2464e4ba5c': 88, '805fe2ba2d15': 79}
```

If all the blocks are on the same DataNode, it is likely you uploaded
the CSV before both DataNodes got a chance to connect with the
NameNode.  Re-run, this time giving the cluster more time to come up.

## Part 3: PyArrow

#### Q6: what are the first 10 bytes of single.csv?

Use PyArrow to read the HFDS file.  You can connect to HDFS like this (the missing values are host and port, respectively):

Hint: Think about which port we should connect on.
```python
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.fs
hdfs = pa.fs.HadoopFileSystem(????, ????)
```

You can then use `hdfs.open_input_file(????)` with a path to open the
file and return a `pyarrow.lib.NativeFile` object.

You can use the `read_at` call on a `NativeFile` to get a specified
number of bytes at a specified offset.

Output the first 10 bytes of `single.csv`.

#### Q7: how many lines of single.csv contain the string "Single Family"?

PyArrow's `NativeFile` implements the `RawIOBase` interface (even
though it is not a subclass):
https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase.

This means `NativeFile` can read bytes at some location into a buffer,
but it doesn't do other nice things for you like letting you loop over
lines or converting bytes to text.  The `io` module has some wrappers
you could optionally use to get this functionality, such as:

* https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedReader
* https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper

## Part 4: Disaster Strikes

Do the following:
* manually kill one of the DataNode containers with a `docker kill` command
* start a new notebook in Jupyter called `p4b.ipynb` -- use it for the remainder of your work

#### Q8: how many live DataNodes are in the cluster?

This is the same question as Q1, but now there should only be one:

```
...
Live datanodes (1)
...
```

You might need to wait a couple of minutes and re-run this until the NameNode recognizes that the DataNode has died.

#### Q9: how are the blocks of single.csv distributed across the DataNode containers?

This is the same as Q5, but you'll need to do a little extra work.
When you make a request to the NameNode, check the status code
(`r.status_code`).  If it is 403, use "lost" as the key for your
count; otherwise, count as normal.

Your output should look something like the following (again, your container ID and the exact counts will vary):

```python
{'c9e70330e663': 86, 'lost': 81}
```

#### Q10: how many times does the text "Single Family" appear in the remaining blocks of single.csv?

There are different ways of extracting the data that is still intact
-- one approach would be to (a) identify good blocks using code from
Q9 and (b) read the bytes for those healthy blocks using a read call
similar to the one in Q6.

Once you decide on a solution, loop through `single.csv`, count the number of times "Single Family" appears in the remaining blocks of `single.csv`, and then output that count.

## Submission

We should be able to run the following on your submission to create the mini cluster:

```
docker build . -f hdfs.Dockerfile -t p4-hdfs
docker build . -f namenode.Dockerfile -t p4-nn
docker build . -f datanode.Dockerfile -t p4-dn
docker build . -f notebook.Dockerfile -t p4-nb
docker compose up -d
```

We should then be able to open `http://localhost:5000/lab` and find
your `p4a.ipynb` and `p4b.ipynb` notebooks and run them.

To make sure you didn't forget to push anything, we recommend doing a
`git clone` of your repo to a new location and go through these
steps as a last check on your submission.

You're free to create and include other code files if you like (for
example, you could write a .py module used by both notebooks).

## Tester:
* Expected that you use Python 3.10.12
* After you push your final submission, try cloning your repo into a new temp folder and run the test there; this will simulate how we run the tests during grading. 
* Copy in `tester.py` from the main GitHub directory into your p4 folder
* Make sure your answers are in cell output - not print statements (see the example below)
```
my_answer = []
for i in range(5):
  my_answer.append(5)
my_answer
```
