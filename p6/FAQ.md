# Project Setup
Before you begin, please run the commands mentioned in the README to obtain the setup.sh file in your P6 directory. Running setup.sh will download the needed files and save you the effort of manually copying over project files.

# Setting up SSH Tunnel
Run ssh <USER>@IP -L localhost:5000:localhost:5000 in your local machine. 

# register_user_type
Part 2 of the instructions specifies the use of a custom register_user_type function for inserting station record data into the database. However, it is possible to achieve the same result without using this function. The evaluation of your solution will be based on its correctness, regardless of the approach taken to insert the data.
